 * Note: This is a basic template for a Struts 2 action that handles a request for a responsive layout.
 * You would need to create the corresponding JSP file (/WEB-INF/views/responsiveLayout.jsp)
 * to display the layout and include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files for responsiveness.
 * Make sure to follow best practices for CSS and JavaScript to ensure the layout is responsive.
